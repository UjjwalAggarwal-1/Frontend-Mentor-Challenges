## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow ? maybe, i am not sure

### What I learned

* including tff files for font

```css
@font-face {
      font-family: Figtree;
      src: url(./assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf);
    }
```

* for divs i can use:
```css
      align-self: center;
      width: fit-content;
```

* for the html, i only used divs. not sure if <p> or <span> or some other alternative would have reduced my code (by not requiring certain css)?

### Continued development

* there is huge doubt in my mind with the width and height?
* should it be fixed, in which case text should be cut off?
* but thats a desing problem so designer is needed i think.
